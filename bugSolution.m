The solution involves using automatic reference counting (ARC) or, if using MRC for legacy reasons, correctly managing the object's lifecycle.  In this case, using `copy` instead of `retain` avoids the double-release issue.  `copy` creates a new instance, preventing unintended consequences when `myString` is deallocated elsewhere.  If forced to use `retain`, meticulously pair each `retain` with a `release` ensuring that  `release` is called only once when the object is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected code:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *myString; // Use copy instead of retain
@end

@implementation MyClass
// dealloc is no longer needed because ARC handles this automatically.
@end
```

**Recommendation:** Use ARC.  It eliminates this class of errors. If you must use MRC, follow strict rules of retain/release pairing and be very careful about the life cycle of objects.
